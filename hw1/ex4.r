# Included in this folder, you will find the dataset "world_cup.data". This file
# contains data on the 2010 World Cup. When you load this data into your
# workspace, you should find that there are 32 observations (teams) with the
# following variables:
#
# <team>: the name of the team for each of the 32 participants
# <gp>: the number of games played over by a team over the entire tournament
# <gs> the number of goals scored by a team over the entire tournament
# <shots>: the number of shots taken over the course of the tournament
# <ga>: the number of goals scored against a team over the course of the
# tournament
# <fouls>: the number of fouls commited by a team over the course of the
# tournament
# <yc>: the total numer of yellow cards earned by a team over the course of the
# tournament
# <rc>: the number of red cards received by a team over the course of the
# tournament

# Implement the function "avgGoalDiff" which gives the average goal differential
# per game (i.e. (goals.for - goals.against)/games.played). Your function should
# take the following variables:
#
# <data>: a data frame representing any subset of the world cup data
# <team.name>: a character string giving (equal to one of the team names in
# <data>) giving the name of the team for which the average goal differential
# will be calculated
#
# Your function should return
#
# <avg.diff>: a numeric giving the average goal differential per game played by
# the given team.

avgGoalDiff <- function(data, team.name) {
    team.data = data[data$team == team.name, ]

}

# Implement the function "cardFoulRatio" which gives the ratio of cards (red or
# yellow) to fouls (i.e. (red.cards + yellow.cards) / fouls). Your function
# should take the following variables:
#
# <data>: a data frame representing any subset of the world cup data
# <team.name>: a character string giving (equal to one of the team names in
# <data>) giving the name of the team for which the average goal differential
# will be calculated
#
# Your function should return
#
# <cf.ratio> the ratio of total card to fouls by the given team

cardFoulRatio <- function(data, team.name) {
    team.data = data[data$team == team.name, ]
    num.cards = team.data$yc + team.data$rc

    return(cf.ratio)
}

# Implement the function "rankAGD" which ranks teams (from highest to lowest)
# based on their average goa differential. HINT: you'll probably want to use the
# function you defined earlier. Your function should take the following
# argument:
#
# <data>: a data frame representing *any* subset of the world cup data
#
# Your function should return:
#
# <ranked.teams>: a vector of team names ordered (from highest to lowest) in
# terms of their average goal differential

rankAGD <- function(data) {
    ranking = order(sapply(data$team, avgGoalDiff, data=data), decreasing=TRUE)
    ranked.teams = data$team[ranking]
    return(ranked.teams)
}

# Load the data here. If you want to use the supplied unit tests, you must keep
# the name <wc.data>. Use your "cardFoulRatio" function with sapply statement
# to find the ratio of cards to fouls for each team. Store this variable as
# <cfr.teams>. Subset the <wc.data> dataset to include only teams with card foul
# ratios less than 0.12. Store this varialbe as <low.cfr.teams>. Run your
# "rankAGD" function on this subset and store the variable as <low.cfr.rank>.
